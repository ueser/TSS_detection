This project aims to detect the transcription initiation events in non-conventional genomic regions, such as intragenic transcription. 

Steps:
1. Take the canonical annotation, filter the genes shorter than 500bp
2. Extract the signal for each gene from 200bp upstream of TSS to TTS
3. Smooth the signal with a kernal smoothing, 50bp window
4. Detect all peaks
5. Get a background null model from the signal for all genes
6. Calculate the 95% of the background distribution and take that as the threshold for the gene of interest
7. Record the thresholded peaks for each gene with their positions and the values 


TODOs:
1. TFs table with their scores and the signal of the intragenic transcription
